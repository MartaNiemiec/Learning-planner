## General info  :information_source: 
Learning planner app is intended mostly for those learning programming. It makes it easier to plan next learning steps.
The app consists of four sections.
In the first one it is possible to pick  icons representing  the gained skills. These can be selected from the popup. 
The remaining three sections are for planning monthly, weekly and daily tasks.
